# Simple-Monte-Carlo

This code shows the core idea of Monte Carlo method with an toy example of stock market.

Monte Carlo methods: are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repated RANDOM SAMPLING to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problem that might be deterministic in principle.
